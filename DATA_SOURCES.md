# Vulnerability Data Sources

This document describes the data sources used by the vulnerability blog post generator and how they are integrated.

## Overview

The vulnerability blog post generator pulls data from multiple authoritative sources to create comprehensive, accurate content. By combining information from various systems, we get a more complete picture of each vulnerability, including:

- Core vulnerability details (description, affected systems, severity)
- Exploitation status and active threats
- Technical details and context
- Mitigation guidance and references

## Testing Data Sources

You can test the integration with each data source using the test-data-sources.js script:

```bash
# Test with default CVE
npm run test:sources

# Test with specific CVE
npm run test:sources:cve CVE-2023-46604
```

This will check each data source and report on its availability and the data retrieved.

## Data Flow

The vulnerability data processing follows this flow:

1. First, attempt to fetch data from MITRE CVE API (primary preferred source)
2. Fetch data from multiple additional sources in parallel (NVD, ZDI, CERT/CC, Exploit-DB, SANS ISC, VulDB)
3. Combine and enhance data in the `createInputData()` function, using MITRE as the primary source when available
4. Additional API calls for threat actor info (AlienVault OTX) and KEV status (CISA)
5. Add vulnerability details from trusted sources like CERT/CC, ZDI, and VulDB
6. Format data for input to the LLM prompt
7. Generate blog post content with descriptive titles based on severity, CVE ID, and vulnerability type
8. Save with enhanced frontmatter including data source attribution

## Extending with New Sources

To add a new data source:

1. Add configuration in `.env.sample`
2. Create a function to fetch and process data from the source
3. Integrate the function in `createInputData()`
4. Add the source to the data attribution in the blog post

## Future Enhancements

Planned data source integrations:

- **Red Hat Security Data API**: For enhanced Linux/enterprise vulnerability details
- **Snyk Vulnerability Database**: For deeper package/dependency vulnerability context
- **VirusTotal**: For malware intelligence related to the vulnerability
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For community security patches and developer context
