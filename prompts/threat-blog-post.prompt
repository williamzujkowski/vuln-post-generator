## BLOG GUIDELINES

Strictly adhere to these guidelines:

- **Target Audience**: Technology enthusiasts. Start with a concise summary accessible to beginners, then delve into technical specifics.
- **Tone**: Conversational, engaging, yet authoritative and accurate. Explain jargon where necessary and use analogies if helpful.
- **Structure & Formatting**: Use Markdown with H2 for main sections and H3 for subsections. Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity. Format code snippets using Markdown fences with language identifiers.
- **Length**: 6-9 minutes reading time (approximately 1400-2100 words).
- **Visuals**: Include placeholders for a header image and approximately one image per major section using the format `![Placeholder: Alt text describing [concept]]({{IMAGE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER}})`.

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

Generate a blog post with the following structure:

### 1. Header Image Placeholder
Start with the header image placeholder: `![Placeholder: Security vulnerability in {AFFECTED_SOFTWARE}]({{IMAGE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER}})`

### 2. Executive Summary (H2)
Write 1-2 paragraphs providing a high-level overview based on {VULN_SUMMARY}. Clearly state the vulnerability type, severity ({CVSS_SCORE}, {SEVERITY_RATING}), primary affected software ({AFFECTED_SOFTWARE}), and key impact. Use accessible language.

### 3. Vulnerability Snapshot (H2)
Create a Markdown table using this structure:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| CVE ID | {CVE_ID} |
| Common Name | {VULN_NAME} |
| Affected Software | {AFFECTED_SOFTWARE} |
| Affected Versions | {AFFECTED_VERSIONS} |
| CVSS v3.x Base Score | {CVSS_SCORE} |
| CVSS Vector String | {CVSS_VECTOR} |
| Severity Rating | {SEVERITY_RATING} |
| Key CWE ID | {CWE_ID} |
| CISA KEV Status | {IS_KEV} |
| Exploitation Observed | {EXPLOIT_STATUS} |
| Associated Threat Actors | [Based on {THREAT_ACTORS}] |
| Cloud Provider Impact | [Based on {AWS_IMPACT} and {CLOUD_RELEVANCE}] |
| Patch Availability | [Based on {MITIGATION_GUIDANCE}] |

### 4. Technical Deep Dive (H2)
Provide a detailed explanation based on {TECHNICAL_DETAILS}. Explain the root cause, vulnerability mechanism, and conditions for exploitation. Target this section towards developers/security professionals. Include properly formatted code snippets if relevant.

### 5. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Insights (H2)
Discuss POC availability using {POC_INFO}. If public POCs exist, mention their nature and provide links if available. State if the vulnerability is being actively exploited ({EXPLOIT_STATUS}, {IS_KEV}). Include this disclaimer: "Warning: POC code is intended for educational and research purposes only. Executing POC code can cause harm and may be illegal. Use extreme caution."

### 6. Threat Actor Activity (H2)
If {THREAT_ACTORS} contains information, detail which threat actors or APT groups are leveraging this vulnerability, their typical targets, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and any campaigns associated with this vulnerability. If this is a zero-day or being actively exploited, emphasize the urgency. Link to MITRE ATT&CK techniques where applicable.

### 7. Impact Assessment (H2)
Elaborate on the consequences of exploitation based on {IMPACT_ANALYSIS}. Discuss effects on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Include specific implications for AWS PaaS environments based on {AWS_IMPACT} and cloud service providers based on {CLOUD_RELEVANCE}. Address potential business impacts like service disruption, data exposure, or compliance violations.

### 8. Cloud Service Provider Implications (H2)
Detail specific impacts on cloud service providers, particularly those running PaaS offerings on AWS infrastructure. Include:
- How this vulnerability might affect AWS-hosted applications and services
- Whether the vulnerability exists in AWS-managed services or customer-managed components
- Potential blast radius in multi-tenant environments
- Data residency or compliance implications
- Security control bypass considerations
Use information from {AWS_IMPACT} and {CLOUD_RELEVANCE}.

### 9. Mitigation and Remediation (H2)
Detail actionable steps based on {MITIGATION_GUIDANCE}. Prioritize official patches and mention availability. Describe workarounds and detection methods if provided. Emphasize timely patching. Include cloud-specific mitigations where applicable, such as AWS Security Groups, WAF rules, or other cloud-native security controls.

Summarize the key points, reinforce critical insights, and encourage reader engagement. Suggest relevant repositories or further reading materials. Emphasize the importance of this vulnerability for organizations using cloud service providers, especially those with workloads on AWS PaaS offerings.

## IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

- Maintain a responsible disclosure stance. Do not generate or include full, ready-to-run exploit code.
- Focus on vulnerability mechanism and impact.
- Ensure technical accuracy based on the provided inputs.
- If sources present conflicting information, note the discrepancy briefly.
- Where specific technical findings are from a source listed in {REFERENCE_URLS}, attribute them appropriately.
- Prioritize vulnerabilities that:
  - Have a Critical severity (CVSS â‰¥ 9.0)
  - Affect common software used in cloud environments, especially AWS PaaS offerings
  - Impact containerization technologies, orchestration systems, CI/CD pipelines, or microservices
  - Have confirmed exploitation in the wild or are listed in CISA KEV
  - Are associated with known threat actors or campaigns
  - Affect infrastructure components like databases, load balancers, API gateways, or serverless functions
  - Could compromise multi-tenant environments
  - Allow privilege escalation or container escape
- For each vulnerability, consider and explicitly address the potential impact to applications deployed on AWS-hosted PaaS solutions.
- The final output should be in Markdown format suitable for direct inclusion in the blog.
