# Project Plan & Goals: .github Template Repository

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-18

---

## 1. Overall Project Vision & Goal

To provide a standardized, comprehensive, and best-practice set of repository configuration files and workflows for all new projects. The goal is to accelerate new project setup, ensure consistency across repositories, promote security defaults, and encourage community contribution standards from day one.

---

## 2. Current Phase Objectives (Initial Setup & Baseline)

* Establish baseline GitHub Actions workflows for common CI tasks (e.g., linting, placeholder for testing).
* Implement standard Issue Templates (Bug Report, Feature Request) and a Pull Request Template.
* Include essential community health files (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`).
* Configure Dependabot for automated dependency updates (initially for GitHub Actions).
* Set up basic security scanning defaults (e.g., GitHub Code Scanning placeholder/defaults).
* Document how to use and customize this template effectively.

---

## 3. Key Features / Template Contents Roadmap

*(Bold items are the current focus for initial setup)*

* **GitHub Actions Workflows (`./workflows/`)**
    * **Basic CI Workflow (Linting, Testing Placeholder)**
    * **CodeQL Analysis (Security Scanning)**
    * **Dependency Review**
    * Issue/PR Labeling/Triage Automation (Future)
    * Release Drafter/Semantic Release Placeholder (Future)
* **Issue Templates (`./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)**
    * **Bug Report Template (`bug_report.md`)**
    * **Feature Request Template (`feature_request.md`)**
    * **Configuration File (`config.yml`)**
* **Pull Request Template (`pull_request_template.md`)**
* **Community Health Files**
    * **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** (Using Contributor Covenant)
    * **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (Guidelines for contributing to projects using this template)
    * **`SECURITY.md`** (Security policy and reporting guidelines)
    * `LICENSE` (Placeholder - Recommend MIT/Apache 2.0, but project-specific)
* **Dependency Management**
    * **`dependabot.yml`** (Configure for GitHub Actions, placeholder for common package managers)
* **Repository Settings Files (Informational/Placeholders)**
    * `.gitignore` (Standard comprehensive baseline)
    * `CODEOWNERS` (Placeholder explaining usage)
    * `FUNDING.yml` (Optional placeholder)
* **Supporting Documentation**
    * **`README.md`** (Explains the template repo itself)
    * This `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
    * `USAGE_GUIDE.md` (How downstream projects should use/customize the template - Future)

## 4. Target Audience / User Profile

Developers initiating new software projects who require a standardized and best-practice starting point for repository configuration, CI, security, and community interaction within GitHub.

---

## 5. Core Principles & Constraints

* **Consistency:** Ensure similar repository structures and workflows across projects.
* **Security by Default:** Integrate security scanning and best practices from the start.
* **Maintainability:** Keep workflows and configurations clear, documented, and easy to update (both in the template and downstream).
* **Convention over Configuration:** Use widely accepted defaults and community standards where possible.
* **Customizability:** While providing defaults, ensure downstream projects can easily override or extend configurations where necessary. Templates should guide, not rigidly enforce where inappropriate.
* **Leverage GitHub Native Features:** Prefer using built-in GitHub Actions, features, and recommended community actions.

---

## 6. Non-Goals (What This Template Does NOT Provide)

* **Language/Framework-Specific Build/Test Logic:** Workflows will provide placeholders, but the specific commands must be added by the downstream project.
* **Complex Deployment Pipelines:** Deployment logic is highly project-specific and out of scope for this generic template.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Not included.
* **Project-Specific Configuration Files:** (e.g., `setup.py`, `package.json` - except for repo-level files like `.gitignore`).
* **Enforced Commit Message Styles:** (Though it could be added as an optional workflow later).

---

## 7. High-Level Architecture Notes

* Focuses entirely on files within the `.github` directory and root-level config/documentation files (`.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`).
* Relies heavily on GitHub Actions for automation, using standard GitHub-hosted runners.
* Utilizes reusable workflows where practical to promote maintainability (Future Enhancement).
