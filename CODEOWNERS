# This is a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams responsible for code in this repository.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, they will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
* @example-org/maintainers

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# Example patterns:
# /docs/ @example-org/docs-team
# *.js @example-org/js-experts
# /src/api/ @example-org/backend-team
# /src/ui/ @example-org/frontend-team

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer:
# /scripts/ user1@example.com user2@example.com
